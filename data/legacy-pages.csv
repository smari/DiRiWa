algeria,Access to Communications,"Access to Internet is increasing in Algeria: according to ITU, 4.5 million algerians have access to Internet, representing about 12.8% of the population (200,000 in 2001 according to the ministry of posts and telecommunications [http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/statistics/at_glance/ARTI02_E.pdf source]). About two third of the users connect from home.

czech republic,Access to Communications,"
Access to communication technologies is similar to other EU countries. GSM communication both at voice and data level, internet communication provided most by large telcom corporation such as O2 or UPC; smaller ISP such as netbox.cz exists too. Traffic limitation is frequent only at GSM level, leaving home-internet without strict limitations.

Under the Act No. 52/2009 Coll. ([http://portal.gov.cz/zakon/52/2009 source, cs]) it is forbidden to inform about names of the victims without their written consent. The restriction also apply to information about the state representatives - for example news cannot inform without written consent about the attack on prime minister. Also it is forbidden to release the leaked police evidence, especially the lawful interception. Therefore the news cannot inform about the coruption suspicion if it came from such source. The penalty for infraction is 1.000.000 Kč (~ 40.000€) (5.000.000 Kč if it is in newspapers, radio, movie or on internet) or 3 years in jail (1 to 5 years if it is in newspapers, radio, movie or on internet) (§ 180 Act No. 40/2009 Coll., Penal code [http://portal.gov.cz/zakon/40/2009/180 source, cs]). The independent blogs, even the participants of discussions, are considered in the same way as the big news sites on the internet, so the larger penalty applies on the bloggers and people commenting the article.

=== Internet market and penetration ===

Internet access in France is generally available to all. The French ISP market is one of the most competitive in Europe, after an overhaul of telecoms regulation aimed at favoring innovative entrants in the early 2000's. Although there is a growing concentration in the last years, this has allowed for an important increase in penetration rates (now around 70%)<ref>﻿Croutte, Patricia. 2010. La diffusion des technologies de l’information et de la communication dans la société française.</ref>, with some of the highest speeds in Europe.

=== Net neutrality ===

Net neutrality is weakly protected. Telecoms regulator Arcep launched a wide public consultation in the Spring of 2010, trying to find the right way to implement the EU provisions of the telecoms package that regulate traffic discrimination. In October 2010, Arcep made [http://www.arcep.fr/uploads/tx_gspublication/net-neutralite-orientations-sept2010-eng.pdf 10 proposals] to protect Net neutrality. Although these provide an comprehensive conceptual toolbox to protect Net neutrality, so far the government and lawmakers prefer to stick to the status quo, waiting on the EU to make a move on the matter.

"
france,Censorship,"
The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_on_the_Freedom_of_the_Press_of_29_July_1881 Law on the Freedom of the Press] of 29 July 1881 speech includes a rather long list of categories of speech that are illegal in France, such as ""incitations to hate"", ""incitations to drug use"", ""apologia of war crimes"", defamation and insults.

On the Internet, illegal speech can be challenged through either a judiciary injunction or a takedown notice, as provided by the [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000005789847&dateTexte=vig LCEN 2004-575 of June 21st], which transposes the EU [[e-Commerce directive]]. Filtering of child abuse material by the administrative authority is also being implemented, after the adoption of a law in February 2011.

=== Notice and Takedown ===

The law provides that Internet service providers are exempted of civil and criminal responsibility for infringing content posted by third parties if they acted promptly to remove or block access to it as soon as they discovered it. Today, ""cease and Desist"" letters are frequently used, even though the LCEN makes it illegal to threaten someone with legal action based on fake claims.

When the LCEN was voted by the Parliament, the Constitutional Council restricted the scope of the law by creating the category of ""manifestly illegal"", i.e content that is deemed illegal even in the absence of a court order, and for which the ISP is required to act promptly to prevent access to the said material. This category was initially limited to hate speech and pedophilia. With this ruling, the Council aimed at avoiding legal uncertainty for ISP (it stressed that is was difficult, “even for a lawyer”, to characterize a given information as illegal), thus protecting freedom of communication of Internet users.

However, this protective notice and takedown regime is undermined by its extension of the types of content that can be deemed “manifestly illegal” and which ISPs are required to remove upon notification. Through case law, judges have gone beyond the above-mentioned types of content and condemned host providers for not expeditiously removing copyright-infringing<ref> Cour d'appel de Paris, June 7th, 2006, Tiscali Media v.Dargaud. http://www.laquadrature.net/wiki/Jurisprudence_sur_la_communication_en_ligne#CA_Paris.2C_7_juin_2006.2C_Tiscali_Media_c.2F_Dargaud_Lombard.2C_Lucky_Comics</ref> and defamatory content<ref>Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris, November 15th, 2004, Juris Data n° 2004-258504</ref>. In a 2008 ruling, a Parisian court went against the Constitutional Council decision by expanding the obligation for a host provider to act expeditiously to remove content that is “likely” to be unlawful<ref>Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris, 15 avril 2008, Jean-Yves Lafesse c/ Dailymotion.
http://www.juriscom.net/jpt/visu.php?ID=1057 </ref>.

=== Judiciary regulation of online speech ===

The LCEN gives juges the possibility to require a hoster or a Internet access providers to take ""any measure"" to prevent injury or damage caused by online content (article 6-I-8). In practice, this provision has led to injunctions for content filtering, such as in the infamous case of the negationist webiste Aaargh, in which the French Court of Cassation confirmed a court order forcing all Internet Access Providers operating in the country to block access to this antisemitic website hosted in the United States.<ref> Aaargh case. Decision n° 707 of June, 19th, 2008. Cour de cassation, First civil chamber. http://www.courdecassation.fr/jurisprudence_2/premiere_chambre_civile_568/arret_no_11682.html</ref>.

Judiciary filtering was reasserted in the context of the HADOPI law aimed at tackling the sharing of cultural works over the Internet. In its article 10, the law grants judges the power to order “all measures needed to prevent or halt such damage to a right of authorship or a related right, against any entity able to help remedy it”.

The 2010 law on online gambling also provides such judiciary filtering measures. In August 2010, a judge ordered French IAPs to block access to a website hosted in the United Kingdom, explicitly referring to various Internet blocking methods, such as Deep Packet Inspection, that are very controversial for of their adverse effects on privacy<ref>Béjot Michel and Bouvier Caroline, 2010, « France: Gambling and Betting on the Internet: French Courts Steps In and Requires the Service Providers to Block an Illicit Website », Address : http://www.gala-marketlaw.com/joomla4/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=291&Itemid=182</ref>.

=== Administrative regulation of online speech ===

Administrative censorship of online content is regularly mentioned by various French politicians. In 2011, France has adopted an administrative censorship scheme under the guise of child protection. The [[LOPPSI]] bill provides that the Homeland Ministry maintains a blacklist of websites including child pornographic content to which French IAPs are required to block access. [http://www.laquadrature.net/en/administrative-net-censorship-adopted-in-france-pedophiles-unworried According] to advocacy group La Quadrature du Net, ""the Trojan horse of child protection opens the door to the generalized censorship of the Internet"".

In December 2010, the Ministry of Economy, which as competence over digital services, asked one of its bodies to reflect upon ways to prevent whistle-blowing website [[WikiLeaks]] from being hosted in France. However, no charges were pressed and the alleged infraction was never defined<ref>﻿Dehesdin, Cécile. “Eric Besson peut-il faire fermer Wikileaks?”, December 2010. http://www.slate.fr/story/31177/eric-besson-wikileaks-hebergeur</ref>. The French hoster of WikiLeaks, OVH, asked judges to determine whether WikiLeaks violates French law. In their [http://www.laquadrature.net/wiki/Jurisprudence_sur_la_communication_en_ligne#TGI_Lille_.2B_TGI_Paris.2C_6_d.C3.A9cembre_2010.2C_OVH.2C_Wikileaks decisions], the judges refused to say whether WikiLeaks was legal or not, invoking procedural hurdles. As of January 2011, WikiLeaks is still hosted in France by OVH.

"
france,Surveillance,"Since 2001, privacy and data protection rights in France have been particularly undermined by two laws: the [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000005631673&dateTexte=20110104 Loi sur la Sécurité Quotidienne] (LSQ, Daily Safety Law), adopted in 2001, and the [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000412199 Loi sur la Sécurité Intérieure] (LSI, Homeland Security), adopted in 2003.

Police normally does not spy on private communications. However, recent scandals revealed that journalists have been spied on by secret services and that thousands of phone lines are scrutinized every year without a judicial authorization.

=== Internet surveillance ===
Internet Access Providers are required to keep a record of their customers' Internet activity and e-mail traffic for at least a year. The LSI grants law enforcement immediate access to the computer data of telecommunications operators, as well as other public and private institutions. Authorities can ask encryption tools providers to give them access to their codes so as to be able to read encrypted online messages.

In February 2011, the government passed a decree establishing the data that must be retained, at the transmission or modification of online content, by the hosting companies, during one year. The decree was described criticized for being much broader that was is required by law, since the information that must be retained include the identifier of the connection at the origin of the communication, the identifier attributed by the information system to the content that makes the object of the operation, the types of protocols used for the connection and for the content transfer, the nature of the operation, the date and hour of the operation and the identifier used by the author of the operation, when provided. Moreover, the hosting providers must also preserve, for one year after the deletion of an account, even more sensitive data such as the date and time when an account is created and the identifier of the connection, his/her complete name, pseudonyms, associated post addresses, e-mail and associated addresses, telephone numbers and even password. Judicial authorities as well as anti-terrorist law enforcement agencies will be able to access such data.

=== Video-surveillance ===

With the LOPPSI bill, a ""newspeak word"" has been created for video-surveillance : video-protection. Huge investments have been made by municipalities, although disputes over who should pay for their maintenance has delayed their adoption. (Cities say it must be paid by the police prefecture, which says the opposite). Big cities like Lyon and Paris have a dense video-surveillance network but it is notorious that the system is undermanned.

"
france,Intellectual Property,"
=== Copyright ===
One of the biggest issue regarding copyright in France is the extent to which case law has undermined the rights of the public in their relation to copyrighted works (for instance the right to private copy).

Downloading or uploading copyrighted material without authorization is both a civil and a criminal offence. France has been the inventor and biggest proponent of ""three strikes"" schemes to crack down on online file sharing. In June 2008, the government introduced a bill aimed at establishing an executive agency ([[HADOPI]]) endowed with the power to disconnect alleged file-sharers from the Internet for a duration of a up to a year after two warnings.

The law was blocked by a historic [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision//2009/decisions-par-date/2009/2009-580-dc/decision-n-2009-580-dc-du-10-juin-2009.42666.html decision] of the French Constitutional Council, which asserted that access to the Internet was a fundamental right protected by Article 11 of the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. This article states that ""The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man"". The Council added that Internet now plays an instrumental role in guaranteeing the effectiveness of that right – free speech –, emphasizing its importance for citizens' ""participation to the democratic life and the expression of ideas and opinions"". 

Following this ruling, a second HADOPI law was presented to ensure that the judiciary authority rather than the HADOPI (an administrative agency) would be competent to pronounce restrictions of Internet access (1500€ fine and a suspension of Internet access for up to one month). The law was finally adopted in the Fall of 2009, and the first e-mail warnings were sent in October 2010. However, observers doubt that any sanction will ever be pronounced due to the political risk the government would face.

=== Patents ===
Software Patents, as for all Europe, are not acceptable according to EU law. On the other hand, numerous attacks by groups in favor of software patents are being launched against this position. The European Patent Office is also famous for a strange practice : despite software patents being unenforceable in EU, it still accepts to register them. The trick is to patent a ""device running the algorithm X"" instead of ""algorithm X"". No such patent as been ever tested to court.

=== Patents ===
Hungary is not really strong on patents ‒ it's only a very small market after all. The patent regulation is according to the EU law. Usually most corporations in Hungary have innovation programmes, which they use to collect the ideas of the hungarian workforce. These ideas are usually added to the corporations international patent pool. All the companies having most patents in Hungary are from the pharma industry.

Here is the [http://www.mszh.hu/hivatalrol/evjel2008.pdf 2008 report by the HPO]. Somewhere in the middle it gets interesting with a couple of pages of statistics:

<blockquote>Not more than 9% of the right-holders of valid patents were Hungarian (12% in the previous year), thus, only 1073 patents were owned by Hungarians. 91% of the right-holders were foreigners, of which the German (26%) and the US (15%) right-holders were in the lead. Of the European patents validated to the territory of Hungary, 32% belonged to German, 12% to US, 10% to French and 9% to Swiss right-holders.</blockquote>

In that light I consider that caution should be exercised in adopting measures which limit access to the Internet for alleged copyright infringements.""

iceland,Censorship,"There is currently no state censorship in Iceland. Some private censorship has been noted, such as in June 2009 when the two largest ISPs in Iceland, [[Vodafone]] and [[Síminn]], censored the anonymous forum ''ringulreið'' due to complaints about online bullying. This censorship caused a sufficient drop in access to the site that it was shut down.

"
iceland,Surveillance,"Icelandic law 81/2003, article 42, provides provisions for [[Data Retention]], at minimum sufficient to link customers to phone numbers, IP addresses and user names for any given point in time, as well as information about every connection that was made, to where, the duration thereof, and the amount of traffic registered. The existence of [[unregistered prepaid SIM card]]s and open WiFi hotspots are amongst of many examples that show that this law is not strictly enforced. It is also known that many [[ISP]]s only retain communications data on IP networks for foreign traffic.

There has been some proliferation of CCTV cameras for law enforcement purposes in recent years.

italy,Access to Communications,"Today, Internet access in Italy is generally available to all. 
In 2005, in order to reduce the risk of public telecommunications and Internet facilities being used by terrorists, the Italian government passed the Pisanu Decree which introduced serious restrictions on Wi-Fi access in public places. The Decree required every Wi-Fi provider to obtain prior authorization from the police, as well as to provide Wi-Fi access only to those users whose identity could be ascertained through an official government-issued identification document, and under the condition that a record of every Internet connection was kept. The Decree has been strongly criticized and the Italian Minister of Home Affairs, Roberto Maroni announced that public Wi-Fi access will be liberalised in Italy starting from January 2011.

italy,Censorship,"Italy blocks access to foreign gambling operators over the Internet by requiring that every Italian ISP  modify their DNS entries accordingly. Italy is also blocking access to many websites containing child pornography. In 2008, access to the Pirate Bay website has been banned by virtue of a law on electronic commerce. Censorship has been lifted on appeal, although access to the website has been blocked again as of 25 May 2010.<br>
On the 17th of December 2010, Italy's Communication Authority (AgCom) approved a new set of regulations for the protection of authors' rights which is currently under public consultation.
The regulation provides for the introduction of a system of Notice and Take-down according to which the AgCom would be entitled to request the removal of copyrighted content which has been illegitimately published in the Italian territory.
The regulation also suggests the possibility of filtering certain Internet websites whose sole purpose is the dissemination of infringing content, or whose servers are located outside of the national territory.

italy,Surveillance,"Article 132 of the Data Protection Code requires every telecommunication service provider to retain  telephone traffic data (without location data) for a period of 48 months for the purpose of detecting and preventing crime. The Law Decree of July 27th 2005 on Anti-terror Measures introduced a minimum data retention period of 29 months for telephone data (including location data) and of 6 months for Internet traffic data. The retention period has subsequently been amended by Law Decree 151/2008 which reduced it to 24 months for telephone traffic, while increasing it to 12 months for Internet traffic necessary to the proper operation of judicial investigations.
The content of communications are excluded from this rule and cannot be recorded unless in compliance with interception legislation.

Due to very good broadband access and high costs for throttling devices, throttling is common only in mobile networks. Most cable and fiber ISPs don't even count traffic. Counting of transferred data on the other hand is very common on DSL, because the major DSL last-mile owner (Slovak Telecom, member of Deutsche Telecom) bills all providers for using their last-mile by traffic (except for weekends). Some providers providing flat-rate have to do throttling based on fair-use policy to avoid costs from Slovak Telecom.

Voice and SMS surveillance is required by law. Holders of the telecommunication license have to provide direct unmonitored access to their network at the operator's cost (the devices are owned by Slovenska Informacna Sluzba - an intelligence agency and Ministry of Interior, which runs police). 

There are no direct monitoring devices in ISP networks, but ISPs have to cooperate based on judge approval. They have to provide full traffic dumps, logs, etc. Slovak police seems to almost always claim it is going after child pornography distributors, even when this is not the case. They say this to convince operators to cooperate (everyone ""knows"" child pornography distribution is bad and they believe that technician at operators' are more willing to help fight this crime than any other). They have no direct control or knowledge if the operator provides all the information.

There are takedown notices when copyright and/or trademarks are involved, but these are usually not very successful. There has been a case of fake pages of ""Orange"" operator and one hacker registered t-zones.sk domain before Eurotel was aquired by T-Mobile. They tried to take the site down, but in the end they just paid whatever the guy asked for the domain (the price has not been disclosed).

Takedown based on trademark abuse has basis in .sk domain registry rules (which is weird, because there can be several different companies having the same trademark, they are based on product areas. I know of matrix.sk domain, which was requested by certain cosmetics company based on trademark issues and it was offered to the other holders of ""Matrix"" trademark: car manufacturers, ...). There is no clear rule about this.

=== Copyright ===

Slovak authorship law (it's not copyright, that is a different concept) is very problematic. It does not allow distribution under free or open-source licenses. The law clearly states, that author has a right to get reward for his or her work. While they can say that they don't want reward in any particular case (in relation to one licensee), it is unconstutional to let go off your right in general. Publication under open-source license is problematic, because we don't know if the author does not abuse this.

The click-wrap licenses are also invalid, every license has to be a contract and that has to be in writing or using qualified electronic signature. For Free Software, this means, that you have no right to use the software unless having a written contract.

There have been no abuses of these problems so far, there is an active Creative Commons community and [http://www.soit.sk/|Society for Open Information Technologies] trying to push reforms in authorship law.

There is a fair use doctrine, which is also a reason for collecting essentially tax from copy machines, CDs, DVDs and other media and also burning devices. These go back to authorship alliances (which are monopolized by state, but not controlled by them, which is very dangerous) and are distributed in a very non-transparent way to the authors, that are members of these.

sweden,Access to Communications,"
Sweden is reportedly in the top league in the world when it comes to broadband accessibility. Broadband speeds are also among the highest in the world. The Swedish state has an obligation to make sure all citizens have access to basic telephony and internet services, but after the privatization of the former state monopoly and all its infrastructure there is no method of which the state can live up to that obligation. A few years ago the Swedish competition authority concluded that merely having been a monopoly in the past, does not make you liable for what the state has promised its citizens.

The Swedish telecommunications markets, both wired and wireless, are fairly competetive. The deregulation of the telecommunications market in Sweden at the end of the 1990s were one of the most frictionless in Europe. Thanks to speedy and, above all, numerous actions against the former monopoly by the Competition authorities and Telecommunications authorities the market has been kept reasonably open to new competitors in all fields. Roaming and peering issues with the incumbent does mean, however, that competitors often have to keep higher costs.

ISPs and mobile phone operators are increasingly concerned with government aspirations for data retention and ISP liability and have publically protested as much in international fora.

"
sweden,Censorship,"
Sweden does not actively censor any printed press, and in fact has one of the stronger frameworks in Europe for source protection and journalist protection. What skewed reporting there is in established media is more likely to do with the Swedish media landscape being 90-95% dominated by two faily large media consortia (Bonniers, Schibstedt).

Swedish ISPs are implementing a voluntary child pornography filter since 2005. The blocking list is maintained by the Swedish police and is kept secret. After a leak in 2007 it was revealed that many of the sites were in fact not related to child pornography, and some sites that had been blocked for a considerable amount of time seemed to relate to arboriculture.

"
sweden,Media,"
The Swedish fundamental laws guarantee a strong protection for media, and primarily sources. As opposed to the American ''whistleblower protection'', in Sweden it is the source who can demand anonymity rather than the journalist granting it, and a journalist is liable for not heeding the source's wishes. As opposed to many other nations, journalists are not liable for what they write in a publication. Instead, each Swedish publication needs to assign an editor who, in a law suit, carries the responsibility for libel or defamation (technically probably also high treason). 

The Swedish press freedom laws date back to the 18th century and have been heavily criticized for being technology dependent (print press) since the fundamental laws were opened for review in 2006. A committee for freedom of speech has been working with the issues of freedom of speech and press freedom in the Swedish media laws since 2006, and have reached a number of worrying conclusions - some of which have been heavily criticized by publishers, editors and journalists.

Hans Schöier, an experienced Swedish publisher, [http://www.unt.se/debatt/forsvara-yttrandefrihetsarvet-1175811.aspx writes in UNT] that the committee seems to want to define which ''types of expressions'' or in which ''type of organization'' the publishing is made to avoid technology dependence, but suggests instead an introduction of presumption for freedom of speech/press freedom protection if a new technology casts doubt on a publishing situation.

The Swedish government has stated as a cause for concern the fact that Swedish freedom of speech and press freedom laws differ greatly from those in other European nations.

"
sweden,Surveillance,"
As of December 2010, Sweden has not yet implemented the European Union data retention directive. The parliamentary proceedings are expected for Spring 2011.

In 2008, the Swedish parliament decided on the so-called ""FRA law"" which grants a civilian intelligence agency subordinated the government the right to browse and intercept all digital communications moving across the Swedish borders. 

Both laws have created controversies. The current opposition ran their election campaign on the promise of dissolving the FRA law (or ""re-evaluate it""), but was expected to be keen on data retention. The government, on their side, opposed data retention but have been pushing strongly for the FRA law. Following two bombings in Stockholm in winter 2010, all animosity is lost and both the biggest opposition party and the government now wishes to keep and extend the FRA law, as well as expand on the number of data items operators and service providers will have to retain once the data retention directive is implemented.

At a local level (and supported from the Minister of Justice Mrs Ask) there are high expectations on the ability of CCTV to prevent crimes, as is seen by a decision in Malmö to surveil several central streets, and a decision in Göteborg where the main railway station is now under surveillance. The Swedish Bureau of Criminal Statistics is doubting the efficiency of the measures, but has concluded that CCTV sometimes helps in parking houses. Sweden was, along with the other Nordic countries, one of the first countries in Europe to create laws protecting citizens against arbitrary television monitoring in the mid-1970s.

Out of the European Union member states, Sweden is one of the countries with largest amount of patents per capita (101 patents per person in 2009). This is likely explained by Swedish companies TetraPak, (Sony)Ericson and AstraZeneca all working in relatively patent intensive industries.

Reportedly, Swedish patent policies in international fora are some of the most aggressive, especially for pharmaceuticals. In a case earlier this year, however, Swedish customs officials chose to interpret grey imports of iPads as imports of ""personal computers"" to lower the tariff (to 0%) for the importing consumers.

tunisia,Surveillance,"The Tunisian authorities practice various forms of Internet surveillance and request that service providers such as Internet cafes become partners in controlling Internet use. For example, the authorities monitor Internet cafes, instruct Internet users to show identification before they can use the Internet in some regions, and hold Internet cafe operators responsible by law for their clients online activities. There is also technical surveillance, whereby downloading or adding attachments to an e-mail must go through a central server. Under the pretext of protecting public order and national security, a 1998 post and telecommunications law enables the
authorities to intercept and check the content of e-mail messages;28 in fact, electronic surveillance such as the filtering of e-mail messages of government opponents has been reported.

to load the software onto its servers and filter content consistently across Tunisia’s 11
ISPs. Tunisia purposefully hides its filtering from Internet users. SmartFilter is designed
to display a 403 error message when a user attempts to access a blocked Web site; the
Tunisian government has replaced this message with a standard 404 error message,
which gives no hint that the requested Web site is actively blocked.
