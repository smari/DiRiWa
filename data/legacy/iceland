== Access to Communications ==
Internet access in Iceland is generally available to all. There are no [[Three Strikes]] laws or any other legal mandates that could restrict a persons access to Internet. Iceland's minister of education and culture stated in Parliament on 17. february 2010 that due to the high level of government services provided through Internet in Iceland and the use of the heavy use of Internet in commerce and other activities, "it could be argued that access to the Internet has become part of the publics civil liberties. In that light I consider that caution should be exercised in adopting measures which limit access to the Internet for alleged copyright infringements." ([http://www.althingi.is/altext/raeda/138/rad20100217T145731.html Katrín Jakobsdóttir's speech, in Icelandic])

== Censorship ==
There is currently no state censorship in Iceland. Some private censorship has been noted, such as in June 2009 when the two largest ISPs in Iceland, [[Vodafone]] and [[Síminn]], censored the anonymous forum ''ringulreið'' due to complaints about online bullying. This censorship caused a sufficient drop in access to the site that it was shut down.

== Surveillance ==
Icelandic law 81/2003, article 42, provides provisions for [[Data Retention]], at minimum sufficient to link customers to phone numbers, IP addresses and user names for any given point in time, as well as information about every connection that was made, to where, the duration thereof, and the amount of traffic registered. The existence of [[unregistered prepaid SIM card]]s and open WiFi hotspots are amongst of many examples that show that this law is not strictly enforced. It is also known that many [[ISP]]s only retain communications data on IP networks for foreign traffic.

There has been some proliferation of CCTV cameras for law enforcement purposes in recent years.
