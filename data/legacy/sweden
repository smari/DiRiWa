The digital rights situation in Sweden is (good|acceptable|'''worrying'''|bad|very bad)

== Access to Communications ==

Sweden is reportedly in the top league in the world when it comes to broadband accessibility. Broadband speeds are also among the highest in the world. The Swedish state has an obligation to make sure all citizens have access to basic telephony and internet services, but after the privatization of the former state monopoly and all its infrastructure there is no method of which the state can live up to that obligation. A few years ago the Swedish competition authority concluded that merely having been a monopoly in the past, does not make you liable for what the state has promised its citizens.

The Swedish telecommunications markets, both wired and wireless, are fairly competetive. The deregulation of the telecommunications market in Sweden at the end of the 1990s were one of the most frictionless in Europe. Thanks to speedy and, above all, numerous actions against the former monopoly by the Competition authorities and Telecommunications authorities the market has been kept reasonably open to new competitors in all fields. Roaming and peering issues with the incumbent does mean, however, that competitors often have to keep higher costs.

ISPs and mobile phone operators are increasingly concerned with government aspirations for data retention and ISP liability and have publically protested as much in international fora.

== Censorship ==

Sweden does not actively censor any printed press, and in fact has one of the stronger frameworks in Europe for source protection and journalist protection. What skewed reporting there is in established media is more likely to do with the Swedish media landscape being 90-95% dominated by two faily large media consortia (Bonniers, Schibstedt).

Swedish ISPs are implementing a voluntary child pornography filter since 2005. The blocking list is maintained by the Swedish police and is kept secret. After a leak in 2007 it was revealed that many of the sites were in fact not related to child pornography, and some sites that had been blocked for a considerable amount of time seemed to relate to arboriculture.

== Media ==

The Swedish fundamental laws guarantee a strong protection for media, and primarily sources. As opposed to the American ''whistleblower protection'', in Sweden it is the source who can demand anonymity rather than the journalist granting it, and a journalist is liable for not heeding the source's wishes. As opposed to many other nations, journalists are not liable for what they write in a publication. Instead, each Swedish publication needs to assign an editor who, in a law suit, carries the responsibility for libel or defamation (technically probably also high treason). 

The Swedish press freedom laws date back to the 18th century and have been heavily criticized for being technology dependent (print press) since the fundamental laws were opened for review in 2006. A committee for freedom of speech has been working with the issues of freedom of speech and press freedom in the Swedish media laws since 2006, and have reached a number of worrying conclusions - some of which have been heavily criticized by publishers, editors and journalists.

Hans Schöier, an experienced Swedish publisher, [http://www.unt.se/debatt/forsvara-yttrandefrihetsarvet-1175811.aspx writes in UNT] that the committee seems to want to define which ''types of expressions'' or in which ''type of organization'' the publishing is made to avoid technology dependence, but suggests instead an introduction of presumption for freedom of speech/press freedom protection if a new technology casts doubt on a publishing situation.

The Swedish government has stated as a cause for concern the fact that Swedish freedom of speech and press freedom laws differ greatly from those in other European nations.

== Surveillance ==

As of December 2010, Sweden has not yet implemented the European Union data retention directive. The parliamentary proceedings are expected for Spring 2011.

In 2008, the Swedish parliament decided on the so-called "FRA law" which grants a civilian intelligence agency subordinated the government the right to browse and intercept all digital communications moving across the Swedish borders. 

Both laws have created controversies. The current opposition ran their election campaign on the promise of dissolving the FRA law (or "re-evaluate it"), but was expected to be keen on data retention. The government, on their side, opposed data retention but have been pushing strongly for the FRA law. Following two bombings in Stockholm in winter 2010, all animosity is lost and both the biggest opposition party and the government now wishes to keep and extend the FRA law, as well as expand on the number of data items operators and service providers will have to retain once the data retention directive is implemented.

At a local level (and supported from the Minister of Justice Mrs Ask) there are high expectations on the ability of CCTV to prevent crimes, as is seen by a decision in Malmö to surveil several central streets, and a decision in Göteborg where the main railway station is now under surveillance. The Swedish Bureau of Criminal Statistics is doubting the efficiency of the measures, but has concluded that CCTV sometimes helps in parking houses. Sweden was, along with the other Nordic countries, one of the first countries in Europe to create laws protecting citizens against arbitrary television monitoring in the mid-1970s.

== Intellectual Property ==

=== Patents ===

Out of the European Union member states, Sweden is one of the countries with largest amount of patents per capita (101 patents per person in 2009). This is likely explained by Swedish companies TetraPak, (Sony)Ericson and AstraZeneca all working in relatively patent intensive industries.

Reportedly, Swedish patent policies in international fora are some of the most aggressive, especially for pharmaceuticals. In a case earlier this year, however, Swedish customs officials chose to interpret grey imports of iPads as imports of "personal computers" to lower the tariff (to 0%) for the importing consumers.
