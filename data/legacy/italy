Digital Rights situation in Italy is not so good

== Access to Communications ==
Today, Internet access in Italy is generally available to all. 
In 2005, in order to reduce the risk of public telecommunications and Internet facilities being used by terrorists, the Italian government passed the Pisanu Decree which introduced serious restrictions on Wi-Fi access in public places. The Decree required every Wi-Fi provider to obtain prior authorization from the police, as well as to provide Wi-Fi access only to those users whose identity could be ascertained through an official government-issued identification document, and under the condition that a record of every Internet connection was kept. The Decree has been strongly criticized and the Italian Minister of Home Affairs, Roberto Maroni announced that public Wi-Fi access will be liberalised in Italy starting from January 2011.


== Censorship ==
Italy blocks access to foreign gambling operators over the Internet by requiring that every Italian ISP  modify their DNS entries accordingly. Italy is also blocking access to many websites containing child pornography. In 2008, access to the Pirate Bay website has been banned by virtue of a law on electronic commerce. Censorship has been lifted on appeal, although access to the website has been blocked again as of 25 May 2010.<br>
On the 17th of December 2010, Italy's Communication Authority (AgCom) approved a new set of regulations for the protection of authors' rights which is currently under public consultation.
The regulation provides for the introduction of a system of Notice and Take-down according to which the AgCom would be entitled to request the removal of copyrighted content which has been illegitimately published in the Italian territory.
The regulation also suggests the possibility of filtering certain Internet websites whose sole purpose is the dissemination of infringing content, or whose servers are located outside of the national territory.

== Surveillance ==
Article 132 of the Data Protection Code requires every telecommunication service provider to retain  telephone traffic data (without location data) for a period of 48 months for the purpose of detecting and preventing crime. The Law Decree of July 27th 2005 on Anti-terror Measures introduced a minimum data retention period of 29 months for telephone data (including location data) and of 6 months for Internet traffic data. The retention period has subsequently been amended by Law Decree 151/2008 which reduced it to 24 months for telephone traffic, while increasing it to 12 months for Internet traffic necessary to the proper operation of judicial investigations.
The content of communications are excluded from this rule and cannot be recorded unless in compliance with interception legislation.

== Intellectual Property ==

=== Copyright ===
The regulation of copyright for fine arts, literary works and cultural content in general is covered in [http://www.interlex.it/testi/l41_633.htm Law 633/1941]. The first legislation regulating performing arts as a whole (music, dance, theatre and cinema) is [http://www.dirittoproarte.com/leggispe/Legge163.htm Law 163/1985] which created the Unified Fund for the Performing Arts (Fondo Unico per lo Spettacolo).<br>
In Italy, the main Copyright Agency is the General Direction for Library Heritage and Cultural Institutes ([http://www.librari.beniculturali.it/ DGBLIC]), whose Section III is in charge of the administration of copyright works and the supervision over the Italian Society of Authors and Publishers ([http://www.siae.it S.I.A.E]) in conjunction with the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
On 23 December 2008, representatives of the SIAE and members of [http://creativecommons.it/ Creative Commons Italy] established a Joint Working Group to investigate the possibility for authors who released their works under a Creative Commons license that precludes commercial exploitation to entrust the SIAE with the collection and redistribution of proceeds. Thus far, nothing has however been officially agreed.

=== Patents ===
In Italy, patents are granted by the Italian Patent and Trademark Office ([http://www.uibm.gov.it Ufficio italiano Brevetti e Marchi]), who is in charge of the industrial property regulatory system in the framework of the Directorate General for Developing Productivity and Competitiveness (DGSPC) of the Ministry of Productive Activities.
Article 12 of the Italian Patent Law ([http://www.bugnion.it/legislazione_italia_dett.php?id=7 Law 1127/1939] as amended by the Presidential Decree 388/1979) implements article 52 of the EPC by providing that computer programs are not patentable as such.
