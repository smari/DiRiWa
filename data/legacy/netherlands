== Access to Communications ==
Internet access in The Netherlands is generally available to all. There are no [[Three Strikes]] laws or any other legal mandates that could restrict a persons access to Internet. The price of Internet access is also relatively low and flat-rate broadband is available for most incomes.

== Censorship ==
Censorship is fairly limited, there are a few ISP's who adhere to censoring-lists setup by the government, but most ignore these. There also have been a few cases where websites where forced to take links down directing to 'illegal' information.

== Surveillance ==
The Netherlands has one of the highest amount of sniffing requests made by the police. Most of these are accepted by default. Data Retention laws are in place and ISP's should record traffic data for at-least 3 months.

=== CCTV ===
There has been a growing amount of CCTV cameras being placed in major city's. Most systems are monitored by private security-companies.

== Intellectual Property ==

=== Copyright ===
