The digital rights situation in Algeria is worrying.

== Access to Communications ==
Access to Internet is increasing in Algeria: according to ITU, 4.5 million algerians have access to Internet, representing about 12.8% of the population (200,000 in 2001 according to the ministry of posts and telecommunications [http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/statistics/at_glance/ARTI02_E.pdf source]). About two third of the users connect from home. More than 70% of the users complain about the bandwith and disrupting communications ([http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/newslog/Algeria+Internet+Penetration+Estimated+At+128.aspx source]).

== Censorship ==
There's no evidence of direct censorship ([http://opennet.net/research/profiles/algeria source]). However, decrees enable the government to set its critics' sites as unreachable. The most famous example is the rachad network which is (or at least was) not accessible within Algeria ([http://www.ifex.org/algeria/2008/06/09/capsule_report_press_freedom_still/ source]).

== Surveillance ==
The minister of Post, Information and Communication Technologies Hamid Bessalah told on November 5th 2009 that he would propose a filtering system, officially to block pornographic and terrorist sites. The system will filter what comes in and out of Algeria ([http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/features/2009/12/15/feature-02 source]).

== Intellectual Property ==

=== Copyright ===
The copyright laws are inspired by the French ones. However they are seldom respected.

=== Patents ===
Software patents don't seem to be effective in Algeria.

== Agencies and Groups ==

=== Digital and Information Related Agencies ===


=== Digital rights groups in Algeria ===
