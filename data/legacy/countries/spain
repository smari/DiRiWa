The digital rights situation in Spain is worrying.

== Access to Communications ==

== Censorship ==
* ''TODO:'' Attempt to shut down websites with movie links even if it was legal before Ley Sinde was approved.
* ''TODO:'' Batasuna website blocked

== Surveillance ==
'''SITEL''' is a Spanish telephone tapping system public since 2001 and ready since 2007, that makes it easier tapping mobile devices, and recording phone conversations if a judge authorizes it. SITEL is used by the National Police and the Spanish National Intelligence Center, among others.

=== Copyright ===
* In Spain it's '''legal''' to share copyrighted files with '''no profit'''. Dozens of court cases have been won, and judges have stated very clearly.
** In spite of this, in the last years a lot of "Culture" campaigns and politicians are saying just the opposite. As result, lots of people are getting confused about the legality of this fact.
* In Spain it's '''legal''' to make private copies for '''your own use'''. But we must pay a digital levy on most digital supports. 

As recently shown by 21 of october 2010 [http://la-ex.net/spain-digital-canon-deemed-illegal-by-the-european-court-of-justice historic ruling] of the European Court of Justice against 5 major collecting societies and in favour of a small family business, in Spain, the struggle against the criminalisation of private copies and against the indiscriminate digital levy is questioning the application of the EU directive on fair compensation.

In Spain, the practices of collection societies and cultural industries lobbies have created a very clear awareness of the abuses that are committed and of existing legislative deficiencies, and have created a very active and well-informed public opinion: Over 200 000 in the [http://wiki.manifiestointernet.org/wiki/P%C3%A1gina_Principal Manifesto for Internet] and in the straight against the law that want to shut sites without judicial ruling; 200 000 in the D’evolution Summit during the EU ministers of culture meeting; 110 000 responses to the threaten to La-EX organization; one[http://molinapirate.blogspot.com/ minister  kick off] in 2009…

On December 21st, 2010, due to massive citizen pressure, the proposed [[Ley Sinde]] law was rejected in the Spanish Congress.

For all this is why we should not see Spain as an exception on the brink of extinction because filesharing it is not illegal, but as a point of departure for a model of non-profit file sharing legal at the global level.

Ley Sinde was finally approved by a deal involving PP, PSOE and CiU political parties, which has caused a lot of discomfort to the Internet users. On 5th March, 2011, it was published in the BOE (Official Bulletin of the State) [http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2011/03/05/pdfs/BOE-A-2011-4117.pdf]
