The digital rights situation in Denmark is worrying

== Access to Communications ==
Internet access in Denmark is generally available to all. The main telecommunications company has a commitment to provide telephone lines to all addresses in the country, and ADSL connections are quite cheap. The energy companies are rolling fiber-optic cables out, but it doesn't cover the whole country yet. 3G mobile broadband is also widely available.

== Censorship ==
The major ISPs voluntarily partake in censoring sites on a child pornography blacklist, governed by the Danish branch of the ''Save the Children'' NGO. Accesses to the blocked sites are allegedly not logged.

Several Danish ISPs have furthermore blocked (DNS) access to file sharing sites such as The Pirate Bay. List of such ISPs include Telenor, Stofanet and Tele2. The list of known sites on this other block list is

* thepiratebay.org
* allofmp3.com
* mp3sparks.com

== Surveillance ==
''Logningsbekendtg√∏relsen'', or the logging announcement, forces internet and cell phone providers to log information about IP addresses or IMEI numbers and their internet habits.

== Intellectual Property ==

[http://www.antipiratgruppen.dk/ Antipiratgruppen] (The Anti-piracy Group) is the entertainment industry copyright enforcement agency.

== Copyright ==

GENERAL:
[http://www.rettighedsportalen.dk/ Rettighedsportalen] is a site (in Danish) established by The Academy for Active Knowledge Sharing (Akademiet for Aktiv Vidensdeling) dedicated to providing information about copyrights and patents. Another resource (also in Danish) is [http://www.ophavsret.dk/ Ophavsret.dk] that also carries a comprehensive list of copyright enforcement agencies (http://www.ophavsret.dk/faq.php).
The Danish Cultural Ministry has also launched [http://www.kum.dk/infokiosk/ Info kiosk] to increase awareness on intellectual property and copyrights.
