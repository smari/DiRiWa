== Surveillance ==
The Tunisian authorities practice various forms of Internet surveillance and request that service providers such as Internet cafes become partners in controlling Internet use. For example, the authorities monitor Internet cafes, instruct Internet users to show identification before they can use the Internet in some regions, and hold Internet cafe operators responsible by law for their clients online activities. There is also technical surveillance, whereby downloading or adding attachments to an e-mail must go through a central server. Under the pretext of protecting public order and national security, a 1998 post and telecommunications law enables the
authorities to intercept and check the content of e-mail messages;28 in fact, electronic surveillance such as the filtering of e-mail messages of government opponents has been reported. Global Voices Advocacy director and Tunisian activist [http://samibengharbia.com/ Sami Ben Gharbia] conducted a test from the Netherlands with two Tunisia-based activists, and confirmed by logging on to their e-mail accounts from the Netherlands that what he saw was not what the bloggers saw when they logged on from Tunisia, and that the bloggers could not access some of the messages they received.


== Filtering ==
Web filtering in Tunisia is achieved through the use of a commercial software pro-
gram, SmartFilter, sold by the U.S.-based company Secure Computing(McAfee). Since all fixed-
line Internet traffic passes through facilities controlled by ATI(Tunesian Internet Agency), the government is able
to load the software onto its servers and filter content consistently across Tunisiaâ€™s 11
ISPs. Tunisia purposefully hides its filtering from Internet users. SmartFilter is designed
to display a 403 error message when a user attempts to access a blocked Web site; the
Tunisian government has replaced this message with a standard 404 error message,
which gives no hint that the requested Web site is actively blocked.
