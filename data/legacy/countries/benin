The digital rights situation in Benin is (good|acceptable|worrying|bad|very bad)

== Access to Communications ==
Connectivity is bad in Benin, 70000 people at the university of Abomey-Calavy are connected with a 6Mbit/s link and a 10000 others at the university of Parakou are connected trough a 2Mbit/s link. The infrastructure of Benin Telecom is, on the other hand, very new and capable to provide a good connexion trough the undersea cables (SAT-3) that going around the african continent. Thus, it's only political problems that block the internet connectivity.
