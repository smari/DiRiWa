The digital rights situation in the Czech Republic is (good|acceptable|worrying|bad|very bad)

== Access to Communications ==

Access to communication technologies is similar to other EU countries. GSM communication both at voice and data level, internet communication provided most by large telcom corporation such as O2 or UPC; smaller ISP such as netbox.cz exists too. Traffic limitation is frequent only at GSM level, leaving home-internet without strict limitations.

== Censorship ==

There are no known cases of individual or targeted censorship to me at this time, please fix this if you know of something. All three GSM operators, however, filter data traffic through IWF black lists. [http://www.vodafone.cz/live/informace_nastaveni/blokovani.htm (vodafone cz)], [http://www.lupa.cz/zpravicky/telefonica-o2-potvrdila-filtrovani-stranek/ (Telefonica O2)], [http://t-press.cz/tiskove_zpravy/2010/1081/ (T-Mobile)]. 

Under the Act No. 52/2009 Coll. ([http://portal.gov.cz/zakon/52/2009 source, cs]) it is forbidden to inform about names of the victims without their written consent. The restriction also apply to information about the state representatives - for example news cannot inform without written consent about the attack on prime minister. Also it is forbidden to release the leaked police evidence, especially the lawful interception. Therefore the news cannot inform about the coruption suspicion if it came from such source. The penalty for infraction is 1.000.000 Kč (~ 40.000€) (5.000.000 Kč if it is in newspapers, radio, movie or on internet) or 3 years in jail (1 to 5 years if it is in newspapers, radio, movie or on internet) (§ 180 Act No. 40/2009 Coll., Penal code [http://portal.gov.cz/zakon/40/2009/180 source, cs]). The independent blogs, even the participants of discussions, are considered in the same way as the big news sites on the internet, so the larger penalty applies on the bloggers and people commenting the article. (The Act is called The muzzle act - "náhubkový zákon").

== Surveillance ==

=== Data retention ===

Telecommunication access logs has to be recorded under European data retention directive 2006/24/EC ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:105:0054:0063:EN:PDF CELEX 32006L0024]) since 2008. Databases are accessible by police, national security agencies. The retention period is 6 months minimal, 12 months maximal. [http://portal.gov.cz/zakon/127/2005/97 (source, cs)]

=== Incidents ===

In February 2011 the Education Ministry has been in the news for other reasons during the past few days. MfD reported two former directors of the minister's cabinet have been spying on approximately 20 officials, reading their e-mail correspondence and hacking into their computers. The minister has distanced himself from the scandal, but the newspaper reports he must have known about the surveillance.

== Intellectual Property ==

=== Copyright ===

[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=137175 Law act 121/2000 (not current version!), en], ([http://portal.gov.cz/zakon/121/2000 current version, cs]) defines the copyright, there are some discussion about possible amendment of this act. OSA and Dilia are exercising their rights under § 95 of copyright act to collect "author's fee". This law has a large controversy in digital world as it applies itself also on blank media storage calculated off from its size. In other words, you pay a fix fee per megabyte if you're buying a blank media, even if you're going to use it to storage non-copyrighted content. At this day, it's 12 Kč per 1G of storage media, 10 Kč per 40G of hard drive, 5 Kč per blank DVD disk... ([http://portal.gov.cz/zakon/488/2006 source, cs])

=== Patents ===

Patents portfolios are not very wide-spread in Czech Republic. 7% of all parents are related to ICT. [http://www.czso.cz/csu/tz.nsf/i/patenty_v_ceske_republice_v_letech_1995_2009 (source, cs)]
